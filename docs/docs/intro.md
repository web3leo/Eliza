## Core Concepts

Eliza is built around several key concepts that enable flexible and powerful agent development:

1. **Actions**: Define behaviors and responses
2. **Evaluators**: Process and analyze interactions
3. **State & Context**: Maintain coherent interactions
4. **Memories**: Store and retrieve interaction data
5. **Messages**: Handle core communication
6. **Goals**: Track objectives and tasks
7. **Relationships**: Manage entity connections
8. **Database Adapters**: Handle data persistence

For details on these concepts, see the [Key Concepts](../api/concepts) guide.
