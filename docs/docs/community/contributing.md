# Contributor Guide

Welcome to the Eliza contributor guide! This document is designed to help you understand how you can be part of building the future of autonomous AI agents, regardless of your technical background.

## The OODA Loop: A Framework for Contribution

We believe in the power of the OODA Loop - a decision-making framework that emphasizes speed and adaptability. OODA stands for:

- **Observe**: Gather information and insights about the project, the community, and the broader AI ecosystem.
- **Orient**: Analyze your observations to identify opportunities for contribution and improvement.
- **Decide**: Choose a course of action based on your analysis. This could be proposing a new feature, fixing a bug, or creating content.
- **Act**: Execute your decision and share your work with the community.

By internalizing the OODA Loop, you can quickly identify areas where you can make a meaningful impact and drive the project forward.

<!--
Low, medium, large. List what kind of risks, and what could be affected.
-->

# Background

## What does this PR do?

## What kind of change is this?

<!--
Bug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
Improvements (misc. changes to existing features)
Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
Updates (new versions of included code)
-->

<!-- This "Why" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->
<!--
## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?
