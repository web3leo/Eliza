# Degen Spartan AI

So you want to make your own AI, huh?

This isn't for the faint of heart. You're gonna need to learn how to run a Node.js application and edit some text files.

# Install Node.js
https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

# Edit the .env file
- Copy .env.example to .env and fill in the appropriate values
- Edit the TWITTER environment variables to add your bot's username and password

# Edit the character file
- Check out the file `src/core/defaultCharacter.ts` - you can modify this
- You can also load characters with the `--charaters=<path>` and run multiple bots at the same time.

## Linux Installation
You might need these
```
apt-get install build-essential libatlas-base-dev
```
